# The Repository for the Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
This repository contains the code we wrote during [The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course from Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.
This repository is organized into two main folders: `playground` and `project`. Each serves a specific purpose to help us organize and keep track of our learning and project work.

## Folder Structure

### Playground

The `playground` folder is where we store the code that we've learned from our classes. This is our sandbox to experiment, practice, and refine our understanding of the concepts taught.

- **Path:** `playground/`
- **Contents:** Class notes, code snippets, examples, and practice exercises
- **Purpose:** To reinforce learning through hands-on practice and experimentation.

### Project

The `project` folder is where we store the projects we develop as part of each lesson. 

- **Path:** `project/`
- **Contents:** Project-specific code
- **Purpose:** To apply the learned concepts through projects.
